# Project Background
Tundra and boreal plant communities are changing rapidly in the early stages of the Anthropocene. In interior Alaska, one of 
the most apparent and ecologically significant shifts in vegetation is the poleward expansion of deciduous shrubs at the 
boreal-tundra ecotone. Though this shift is driven primarily by fluctuations in abiotic factors brought on by global climate 
change; an increasing body of research suggests that the top-down trophic effects of vertebrate herbivores may also play an 
important role in regulating shrub growth and expansion. Our aims for this study are to better understand the interactive 
effects of climate and herbivory on the growth of northern shrub species and to estimate thresholds at which herbivory might 
buffer against shrubification in northern Alaska.  

# Project Objectives:
1. Write R code for stratified random subsampling of stem sections for mounting and ring measurement. 
2. Write R code to assess the relationship between measured browser variables and shrub characteristics. 
3. Write R code to analyse dendroecological data
